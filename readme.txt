[h1]What Is This?[/h1]

This mod adds persistent blood drips when players are bleeding, making them trackable.

The blood drips persist between server restarts etc like any object in-game.

The chance of blood drips and the time persistence of them is configurable.

[h1]Installation Instructions:[/h1]

Install this mod like any other mod - copy it into your server folder and add it to your mods list. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys if you're not using a server management tool like OmegaManager which does that automatically.

This server must be run on both the client and the server.

A JSON config file for adjusting the blood drip settings will be automatically created in server_profiles/Zenarchist/ZenBloodDripsConfig.json - the chance of blood drips is triggered every ~3 seconds server-side.

[h1]Repack & Source Code:[/h1]

[h1]Buy Me A Coffee:[/h1]

All my mods are free and open source, but it takes an enormous amount of time to put some of these mods together. If I've helped you out, please consider helping me buy my next coffee! I don't expect it, but I very much appreciate it.
